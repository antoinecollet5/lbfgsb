  abstract = {An algorithm for solving large nonlinear optimization problems with simple bounds is described. It is based on the gradient projection method and uses a limited memory BFGS matrix to approximate the Hessian of the objective function. It is shown how to take advantage of the form of the limited memory approximation to implement the algorithm efficiently. The results of numerical tests on a set of large problems are reported.},

These representations allow us to efficiently implement limited memory methods for large constrained optimization problems. In particular, we discuss how to compute projections of limited memory matrices onto subspaces. We also present a compact representation of the matrices generated by Broyden's update for solving systems of nonlinear equations.},

It is intended for problems in which information on the Hessian matrix is difficult to obtain, or for large dense problems. L-BFGS-B can also be used for unconstrained problems and in this case performs similarly to its predessor, algorithm L-BFGS (Harwell routine VA15). The algorithm is implemented in Fortran 77.},
